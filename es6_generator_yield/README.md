# Generator,Yield

## Generator
  - *Generators provide a powerful alternative: they allow you to define an iterative algorithm by writing a single function which can maintain its own state.*
  - *A generator is a special type of function that works as a factory for iterators. A function becomes a generator if it contains one or more yield expressions and if it uses the function* syntax.*

## Yield
  - The yield keyword is used to *pause* and *resume* a generator function
